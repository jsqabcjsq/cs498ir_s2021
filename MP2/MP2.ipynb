    "Let us examine the problem of calculating geometry normals.  The code below will load triangle mesh files, which are produced by CAD programs and mature 3D scanning pipelines, and will also generate point clouds, which are produced by raw 3D scanning from laser sensors and RGB-D cameras.\n",
    "\n",
    "A. In the first marked cell, implement a function that calculates the normals of each triangle in the mesh. *Recall that a normal is a unit vector pointing to the outside of the geometry.*  Use the cell afterwards to debug your estimates.  The results will appear in the visualization window under the cell below.\n",

In the second marked cell, use the [klampt.model.geometry.point_cloud_normals()](http://motion.cs.illinois.edu/software/klampt/latest/pyklampt_docs/_modules/klampt/model/geometry.html#point_cloud_normals) function to produce estimates of normals for a point cloud.  There are several parameters to this function that affect the quality of the normal estimates for varying resolutions and noise characteristics.  Tune these parameters to give \"reasonable\" estimates at least when noise is slow.\n",
    "\n",
    "   Implement the `normal_rmse` function to comptue the root-mean-squared-error (RMSE) between the ground truth normals and the ones calculated by your function.  For two sets of points $(x_1,...,x_N)$ and $(y_1,...,y_N)$, RMSE is given by:\n",

Vary the parameters to at least 3 values to better understand these trends.  Place your answers in the space designated for written answers."
